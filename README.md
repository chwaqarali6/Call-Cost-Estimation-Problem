# Call-Cost-Estimation-Problem
Write a program that computes the cost of a long distance call. The cost of the call is determined according to the following rate schedules. 
A call started between 8:00 and 18:00 is billed at a rate of 5 rupees per minute. 
A call started before 8:00 or after 18:00 is charged at a rate of 3.25 rupees. 
Any call started on a Saturday or Sunday is charged at a rate of 1.5 rupees per minute.
For example if a call starts at 17:55 and ends at 18:05 on Thursday then the charges on this call will be 41.25 (25 rupees for first 5 minutes and 16.25 rupees for rest of the time).   The input to the program will consist of the time the call started (hour and minute), day of call and the length of call in minutes. The time is to be input in 24-hours notation. The output will be the cost of call.
